# mRNA

Scale, in ascending order: atom < molecule < nucleotide/nucleic acid/base which all refer somewhat to ACGT in DNA (ACGU in RNA, ribonucleic acid) < codon (3 RNA bases). Hence there are 64 possible codons, that encode 20 amino acids (molecular compounds).

That encoding is called the genetic code. It is *not* a simple scheme of one combination of 3 bases (possibly with repetition) mapping to a single amino acid, [even though that produces 20 possibilities too](https://gist.github.com/guillaumekoenig/a9ba49446721504bc1d021a7a6f6c90c#file-combi_rep-py-L10). It was cracked experimentally by synthesizing chains of codons and looking at the resulting amino acid chains. AUG is the start sequence codon, UAG the stop sequence codon.

Ribosomes translate RNA into chains of amino acids. The resulting chains fold on themselves in 3D: those are the proteins. They perform biological functions.

The human genome has 3 billion base pairs in 23 chromosomes (6 billion when accounting for homologous pairs of chromosomes). *E. coli*'s has 4.5 million base pairs in one chromosome.

Phenotype: physical expression of traits, shaped by genes and the environment. Genotype: expression of traits in the genes.

mRNA is the kind that DNA is copied into and brought into the ribosome (m for messenger). Then codons need to be translated into amino acids: that's the role of tRNA, molecules having the *anticodon* that matches the codon (by base-pairing) and holding the associated amino acid. mRNA is short-lived (minutes). Ribosomal RNA (discussed later) is much more prevalent, and long-lived.

It was experimentally verified that codons come in 3 bases the following way. Insert a single base, and the resulting protein is deadly. Same if you insert 2 bases. However insert 3, and you get a mostly functional protein.

# Introns and splicing

DNA is translated into mRNA in the nucleus (by base pairing), before it is exported to the cytoplasm for building the protein. In the nucleus, it's referred to as precursor mRNA to distinguish it from when it's in the cytoplasm. Early on it was clear that E. coli's mRNA was the same throughout. But not so in larger animals: precursor mRNA was on average 10 times larger than the final one in the cytoplasm. How come?

On the adenovirus (common cold), the mRNA in the cytoplasm shows parts that are spliced out compared to its source DNA. The non-coding DNA parts are called introns.

- Yeast: 6000 protein-coding genes
- Humans: 24000 protein-coding genes (even though much more complex than yeast!), hundreds of types of cells

Introns allow to build protein variants. For example, introns can serve to alter the end of a protein: a variant with a greasy end (to attach) vs another variant with a sugary end (to float freely). Humans then have ~100k different kinds of proteins.

Nuclei have 6 varieties of small strands of RNA dubbed U1..U6 (rich in uracil). It was found those pair up with the beginning of known introns, allowing to cut at that spot. They are snRNA (small nuclear RNA), and are non-coding (neither are tRNA nor ribosomal RNA).

The hemoglobin protein carries oxygen in the blood. It's made of 4 amino acid chains: 2 alpha-globin chains, and 2 beta-globin chains. Sickle cell disease is due to a mutation on the beta-globin chain. But beta-thalassemia isn't caused by a mutation. Instead it's due to a mutation in the intron, that makes the spot look like an end marker.

# Catalyst

A catalyst accelerates a reaction. It can be a chemical catalyst (for example baking soda) accelerating a chemical reaction, or a biological catalyst (called an enzyme) accelerating a biochemical reaction. An early example of enzyme known in the 19th century is zymase, which turns sugar into alcohol + CO~2~ (in other words it enables fermentation).

Crystallizing a substance makes it pure (reducing it to crystals). Doing so with a particular protein in a catalyzing substance, and observing the result still has its catalyzing property, leads to the belief that all enzymes are proteins. Note that proteins are always the result of biological processes. (Proteins haven't been found outside Earth, only amino acids.) They break down when boiled.

But not all enyzmes are proteins. That's what Cech got the Nobel for: finding they can also be pure RNA. Unclear: how is the RNA enyzme "activated", once isolated, in their experiments?
