-   What's a microorganism living with host yielding mutual benefit?
    A symbiont.
-   What's a microorganism living with host causing disease? A
    pathogen.
-   What does micro refer to, in microorganism? They're a few
    micrometers in size.

-   Meaning of the names prokaryote and eukaryote? "before" kernel (ie not having a proper one), and "true" kernel (having one).
-   Example of unicellular organism?   Bacteria (prokaryote), yeast (eukaryote)
-   Example of multicellular organism? Humans (multicellular organisms are always eukaryotes?).
-   Common point of microorganisms? All hold genetic material.
-   Where is the genetic material stored in prokaryotes? in a
    kernel-like shape ("nucleoid") floating in the cell
-   Where is the genetic material stored in eukaryotes? in the kernel
    ("nucleus")
-   Subdivisions of prokaryotes? Bacteria and Archaea. They're
    unicellular.
-   Two particularities of viruses? They're made of genetic material,
    but they're not alive on their own.
